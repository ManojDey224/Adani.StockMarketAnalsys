This project is a Python-based stock market analysis tool that allows users to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices. The tool uses a variety of technical analysis techniques, including moving averages, Bollinger bands, and relative strength index.

The project is divided into two main parts:

Data collection: The first part of the project involves collecting historical stock data from a variety of sources. The data is then cleaned and formatted for analysis.

Data analysis: The second part of the project involves analyzing the historical stock data using technical analysis techniques. The results of the analysis are then used to make predictions about future stock prices.

The project is designed to be used by both beginner and experienced investors. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. The project also includes a user interface that makes it easy to interact with the tool.
